Hi! My name is Noah Horsley. I'm a data scientist who enjoys learning new skills, solving difficult problems, and using data to communicate ideas. My background is in research, but I have many additional interests and enjoy how applicable data science is to a wide variety of fields. I graduated with a M.S. from the University of Illinois and am looking for data-driven work in a research or industry setting.
